=== Organize your content like a pro ===

Everyone starts their WordPress website from scratch. But over time, the content on a website can grow significantly. Especially with (WooCommerce) stores, (LearnPress) learning content or (bbPress) forums, hundreds or even thousands of entries quickly accumulate in your content management system.

You can lose the overview quickly or invest a lot of time digging through the content using filters. It would be easier if you could intuitively organize the content into folders. Just like you are used to from your Windows Explorer or Mac Finder for files. This is exactly what category folders of Real Category Management enable you to do. Managing content in folders is a better form of content management than clicking through long lists!

Real Category Management extends the functionality of standard WordPress custom post types and taxonomies. Custom post types - e.g. pages, WooCommerce products, or testimonials - are used by hundreds of WordPress plugins to manage new types of content in WordPress. Each of these contents can be efficiently managed with the folder tree of Real Category Management. Taxonomies - by default there are categories for posts - on the other hand, are the way to group content. We take these groups and visualize them as (hierarchically structured) folders to clearly display your content in folders.

That allows you to keep track of hundreds of articles in the online store, various lessons in your learning platform or thousands of threads in your forum at any time and to organize content efficiently!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress 5? =
**Yes, we support WordPress 5.x** and regularly update Real Category Management to support future versions.

= Are the categories in this plugin in sync with the taxonomies (e.g. category for posts) in WordPress? =
**Real Category Management uses the standardized WordPress taxonomies** and offers you a better interface to manage your content. Therefore, existing taxonomies like categories for posts or product color for WooCommerce products can be used and all information will also be available, should you uninstall our plugin.

= Can I create new taxonomies to organize my content with this plugin? =
For example, if your theme adds a new custom post type like "Movies", but without a taxonomy (e.g. category), you can't order the movies for now. You have to create a taxonomy first. Real Category Management can't do that. However, we have created an integration with the popular plugin [Custom Post Type UI
](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/). With this plugin you can easily create taxonomies.

= Where can I find documentation or support for the plugin? =
