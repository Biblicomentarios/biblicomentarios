## Installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don‚Äôt need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Lazy Blocks, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type ‚ÄúLazy Blocks‚Äù and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù.

### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our Lazy Blocks plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
