Order your posts in subpages: multipage posts will have a table of contents linking single subpages with their titles.

== Description ==

Multipage for WordPress will make you able to order a post in multipages, giving each subpage a title and having a table of contents on the first or on every subpage.

= Make order in your posts! =
Forget about extremely lengthy pages, diffculty to find a post section. With Multipage you can divide every post into many subpages, giving them a title. Then a table of contents will appear to redirect your visitors to the wanted post subpage.

= Benefit from different subpages =
Every subpage will generate a different page view, so your statistics will benefit.

= Forget about the old `&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;` =
The old WordPress code is not useful anymore. Even if you do not indicate a title for your `[nextpage]` code, Multipage will use a default title in the form "Page #".

= Customize it as you want =
Multipage comes with a minimal css in order to make the user customization simpler. You can create a new multipage.css file and put it in the theme folder /css/ so you can use your own CSS. It is important not to change the file provided with the plugin because at the first following update it will be lost. The second option is to modify the Multipage CSS in your own theme CSS, overriding the standard classes.

= Let us know you care about this =
Please let us know how much you care about Multipage development rating it (5 stars).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `sgr-nextpage-titles` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the Multipage through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin by going to the `Multipage` menu under `Settings`
4. Add a few `[nextpage title="Pretty title"]` codes to your posts

== Screenshots ==

1. The settings page.
2. The block editor with a subpage block.
3. How the post will look like.
