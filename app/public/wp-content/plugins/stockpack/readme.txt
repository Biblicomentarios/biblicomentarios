= When will my favourite provider be supported? =
We are aiming to support all providers that give us api access. However that takes time and we prioritize based on request. Open a support ticket for your provider if one doesn't exist and we will take that into account. If a ticket exists already, add a comment there so that it gets more priority.

= Can I load images from my own source? =
We are considering adding Google Photos, Dropbox as well as Amazon S3. Please create a support forum request so that we can see how much demand there is. If you already find a thread for that, please comment on it.

There is a step by step guide available at [https://stockpack.co/about](https://stockpack.co/about)

= Can I load images from my own source? =

Yes, you are allowed to change the provider you want to use at any time. You can do that from the stockpack dashboard or from the select inside the plugin.

= Can I restrict the number of providers? =
Yes, you can remove some of the providers using the `stockpack_providers` filter. You can read more about it at [https://stockpack.co/blog/how-to-filter-the-visible-stock-image-providers-select/](https://stockpack.co/blog/how-to-filter-the-visible-stock-image-providers-select/)
