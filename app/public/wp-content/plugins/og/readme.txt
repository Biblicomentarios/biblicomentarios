Simple method to add Open Graph metadata to your entries so that they look great when shared on sites.

== Description ==

The [Open Graph protocol][] enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.  Most notably, this allows for these pages to be used with Facebook's [Like Button][] and [Graph API][].

The Open Graph plugin inserts the Open Graph metadata into page head section and provides filters for other plugins and themes to override this data, or to provide additional Open Graph data.

No configuration, pure power.

Plugin grabs data from content and if contains YouTube URL, then plugin try to get movie thumbnail and use it in og:image.

If the post contains YouTube or Vimeo links, this plugin saves as post meta video thumbnail link and add it to og:image as post thumbnail.

Rich filters implementation to allow data change.

= I installed OG and ... nothing happens! =

Please be patient, sometimes you need more a day to see results. The reason of this is cache on Facebook. But check your plugins too and if you use and caching plugins, try to do "flush cache" on your site.

You can force FB to refresh OpenGraph data by using this page https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/. Just go to Sharing Debugger, enter your URL and hit the button "Scrap Again".

= How to filter values? =

Use auto filters. If you have value like this:

    <meta property="og:title" content="WordPress Trunk" />

Then auto filter is created like this:

og_ + (word before ":") + _ + (word after ":") + _value

In this case:

og_og_title_value

    add_filter('og_og_title_value', 'my_og_og_title_value');
    function my_og_og_title_value($title)
    {
        if ( is_home() ) {
            return __('This is extra home title!', 'translate-domain');
        }
        return $title;
    }

Use auto filters. If you have value like this:

    <meta property="og:title" content="WordPress Trunk" />

og_ + (word before ":") + _ + (word after ":") + _meta

In this case:

og_og_title_meta

    add_filter('og_og_title_meta', 'my_og_og_title_meta');
    function my_og_og_title_meta($title)
    {
        if ( is_home() ) {
            return '<meta property="og:title" content="WordPress Title" />';
        }
        return $title;
    }

= How to setup default image? =

Use filter "og_image_init":

    add_filter('og_image_init', 'my_og_image_init');
    function my_og_image_init($images)
    {
        if ( is_front_page() || is_home() ) {
            $images[] = 'http://wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/DSCN0570.jpg';
        }
        return $images;
    }

        }
        return $images;
    }

= How to add Facebook app_id? =

OG plugin is super simple and we do not plan to add any "options page" which is needed if you want to have data like "fb:app_id" or "fb:pages".

But, if you really wanna use OG and serve "FB" OpenGraph tags, then you can use `og_array` filter to add (or modify) OpenGraph tags.

    add_filter( 'og_array', 'add_og_facebook_data' );
    function add_og_facebook_data( $og ) {
        $og['fb'] = array(
            'app_id' => 'my-app-id',
            'pages' => 'foo, bar',
        );
        return $og;
    }


= How to disable author URL (article:author)? =

Use "og_article_author_value" filter, to return empty value for
"article:author" key:

    add_filter( 'og_article_author_value', '__return_empty_string' );

= How to disable featured image as og:image? =
