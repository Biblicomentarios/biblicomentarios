TaxoPress allows you to create and manage Tags, Categories and all your WordPress taxonomy terms.

== Description ==

TaxoPress allows you to create and manage Tags, Categories and all your WordPress taxonomy terms. With the TaxoPress plugin, you can build new taxonomies, and any taxonomy to different post types. 

* Add Categories to your Pages? That's no problem with TaxoPress. 
* Tags for your Media Library? That's easy with TaxoPress.
* Organize many post types with one taxonomy? TaxoPress is the right choice.

In TaxoPress, you can manage taxonomies, and also terms. There are tools for you to add, rename, remove, delete and even merge terms.

= Six Key Features in TaxoPress =

1. **Manage taxomomies**: You can create new taxonomies and edit all the settings for each taxonomy.
2. **Tag Clouds**: Create dynamic tag clouds with many configuration options.
3. **Manage terms**: Quickly add, rename, remove, delete and even merge terms.
4. **Automatically create terms from posts**: TaxoPress can analyze your posts and automatically create relevant Tags and Categories.
5. **Automatically suggest terms from posts**: TaxoPress can use the Dandelion API and OpenCalais API to analyze your WordPress content and suggest Tags that you can add to your post.
6. **Link words to Tags**: If you have a term called “WordPress”, the Auto Links feature will find any instances of “WordPress” in your content and add link to the archive page for that tag.

= Feature #1. Create and Manage Taxonomies =

TaxoPress can all the taxonomies created by WordPress and your plugins and themes. You can change the settings for each taxonomy. For example, you can change the visual labels, and control whether the taxonomy is organized in parent-child relationships. You can also assign your taxonomies to different post types.

= Feature #2. How to Add Tag Clouds =

TaxoPress allows you to show a cloud of the Tags used on your site. The most popular tags are shown in a large font. The Tag Cloud can be show in one of three ways:

* With a shortcode.
* With the "Tag Cloud" widget.
* With PHP code in your template files.

= Feature #3. How to Manage Terms =

The “Manage Terms” screen in TaxoPress provides you with several useful tools to manage the terms on your site. These tools can be used with any taxonomy. Here

* **Add terms**: Quickly add terms to your content.
* **Rename terms**: Change the name of your terms in bulk.
* **Merge terms**: Combine existing terms together. Very useful for fixing typos in your terms.
* **Remove terms**: Remove terms from all posts, without deleting those terms.
* **Delete terms**: Delete terms in bulk.
* **Delete unused terms**: Delete any terms that are rarely used.

= Feature #4. How to Automatically Create Terms =

This feature allows WordPress to examine your post content and title for specified terms and automatically add those terms as Tags. Here’s an example of how it works:

* You add “WordPress” to the keywords list in TaxoPress.
* If your post content or title contains the word “WordPress”, then TaxoPress will automatically add “WordPress” as a term for this post.

= Feature #5. How to Automatically Suggest Terms =

The Suggested Tags feature in TaxoPress will analyze your WordPress content and suggest Tags that you can add to your post. The default option is “Local Tags”. These are Tags that have already been created on your site. It is possible to use APIs to automatically suggest Tags for your content. The Dandelion API and OpenCalais API integrations can analyze your Posts and Pages and automatically make suggestions for new Tags.

[Click here to read about suggesting terms](https://taxopress.com/docs/introduction-to-suggested-tags/).

= Feature #6. How to Link Words to Tags =

The Auto Links feature in TaxoPress will automatically add links to your content. If you have a term called “WordPress”, the Auto Links feature will find any instances of “WordPress” in your content and add a link to the archive page for that tag. So any instances of “WordPress” will link to /tag/wordpress.
