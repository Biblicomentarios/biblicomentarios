WPA SEO Auto Linker assists in creating cornerstone SEO content. This is not a replacement for tools like Yoast SEO but an extra tool.

== Description == 

Want to automatically create cornerstone content? WPA SEO Auto Linker helps get this done. Simply create a new keyword or a new phrase. The system will link that keyword or phrase to your chosen dofollow URL. Through the settings, it is easy to finetune the workings of this plugin. For performance, it is best to make use of a caching engine.

"Using this plugin didn't just help define cornerstone content in our SEO strategy, it also increased pageviews by 18%. The average visitor spends 13 seconds more on our website." - Roelof van Doorn, technical editor at GadgetGear.nl

== Installation ==

1. Upload the complete wpa-seo-auto-linker folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
2. Go to the Plugins page and activate the plugin.
3. Use the WPA SEO Auto Linker settings page under settings to change the settings for WPA SEO Auto Linker.
4. Enjoy the automatically inserted links.

Migrating from SEO Auto Links?
Just deactivate the original plugin. The current version uses the exact same settings table in the database. This means you don't loose your list of URL's you have built. We will maintain this functionality till july 2018. Do create a back-up before installation. Better safe than sorry.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin compatible with Gutenburg? =

We are curretly working on supporting Gutenburg. Please mind that Gutenburg is work in progress and there's still lots of changes being made to the editor. Gutenburg isn't stable yet, but our plan is to have solid Gutenburg support once Gutenburg is stable.

Yes is is, just like with other SEO plugins. We are working on menu integration so you have our tool sitting next to Yoast's options.
