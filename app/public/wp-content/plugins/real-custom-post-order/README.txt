=== Why should you create a custom post order? ===

Many WordPress sites grow over time and with it the number of posts, pages, products, etc. It can be difficult to find the right content that is related to each other if you use the default order by publication date from WordPress. A custom order of posts - whether it's a post order, a custom page order, a custom product order, or a custom post type order - can help you organize your content in a more intuitive way that helps you find your content more simply and quickly.
